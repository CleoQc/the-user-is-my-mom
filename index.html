      <h1>Your website should be so simple, my mom could use it.</h1>
      <h1>You're not my mom. She'll test it for you.</h1>

      <p><b>WHAT</b>: I'll get my mom to review your website. I'll send you a document outlining where my mom got stuck, what I think you could do to fix that, and a screencast of her going over the website.</p>
      <p><b>HOW MUCH</b>: $250 per site.</p>

      <p>More details:</p>
      <p>My mom is a lovely woman who tutors SAT/ACT students, and likes quilting and hiking.  She has a love/hate relationship with technology, doesn't know what a twitter is, and only recently discovered how to find windows she's minimized.</p>

      <p>One of the core tenets of UX is that you should design with your mother in mind.  She should be able to understand and use any feature of your site, because if she can't figure it out, other users will struggle as well.  Wonderful idea.  The thing is, it is hard to test.</p>

      <p>Let's be honest - your mom loves you too much to give you honest feedback.  My mom thinks you're probably a lovely person, but hates bad websites far more.</p>

      <p> My mom (with a lot of help from me and Richard) will test this for you.</p>

      <p>FAQ:</p>

      <p> • Will you actually do this? <i>Yes.</i></p>
      <p> • Who are you? <i>Richard is a UX professional and full stack developer. He's been doing this for a long time. Here is his <a class='website' href="http://burntfen.com">website</a>, his <a class='website' href="https://github.com/RichardLitt">github</a>, his <a class='website' href="https://twitter.com/richlitt">twitter</a>, and his <a class='website' href="http://theuserisdrunk.com">professional drinking problem</a>. I'm an entrepreneur and full stack developer.  I've also been doing this for a long time.  Here's my <a class='website' href="http://scottyallen.com">website</a> and my <a class='website' href="https://twitter.com/scottyallen">twitter</a>.</i></p>

      <p> • How did you convince your mom to do this? <i>I told her Richard was tired of getting drunk for money. And I told her I'd split the money with her.</i></p>
      <p> • Can I pay your mom to review a porn site? <i>Dude, no. We'll refund your money if I'm too embarrassed to show your site to her.</i></p>
      <p> • Will you post her screencasts publicly? <i>Yes.</i></p>
      <p> • Is this your only job? <i>No. My mom tutors SAT/ACT students full-time. Richard and I both have fulfilling jobs chaning the world.</i></p>
      <p> • Wasn't this cheaper earlier? <i>Yes. Raising my prices is my way of throttling the amount of jobs. My mom is a busy lady.</i></p>
      <p> • My mom would be perfect for this - can I sign her up? <i>Yes! We're accepting suggestions for future moms to work with, so we can review more sites.  Fill out this <a class="website" href="">form</a></i></p>

        <p class='intern'>Richard also review websites while both <a href="theuserisdrunk.com">drunk</a> and sober. If you're interested in that, please get in touch.</p>

      <p class='intern'><i>Think of me like a user, but with a large knowledgebase on best practices, and no legal liability for your company. Actually, speaking of liability: I will ensure that I drink responsibly.  I take all blame if I accidentally do. I will ensure that I do not endanger anyone else in the process. You waive all responsibility for me upon payment. If you are concerned about me, please contact me. If you or your loved ones struggles with alcohol, talk to your doctor. Various types of therapy with real trained and certified therapists have good success rates backed by actual scientific evidence, as do certain prescription drugs. Combining them likely has an even better success rate. Drink responsibly. </i></p>
