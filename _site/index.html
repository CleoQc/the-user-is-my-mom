      <h1>Dear internet:<br>My mom is tired of your shit.</h1>

      <h1>She can't understand your website and it isn't her fault.</h1>

      <h1>It's time we talked.</h1>

      <p><b>WHAT</b>: My mom will review your website. We'll send you a screencast. We'll send you a proper writeup too, with some motherly UX advice.
      <p><b>HOW MUCH</b>: $100 per site.</p>

      <p class='cta'><a href="https://plasso.co/s/cyVF2sU0Iq">Let's do it!</a></p><br />

      <p>More details:</p>
      <p>My mom is a lovely woman who tutors high school students, and likes quilting and hiking. She has a love/hate relationship with technology, doesn't know what a twitter is, and only recently discovered how to find windows she's minimized.</p>

      <p>A common UX heuristic is to design with your mother in mind. She should be able to understand and use any feature of your site, because if she can't figure it out, other users will struggle as well. Makes sense, right? The thing is, it's hard to test.</p>

      <p>Your mom loves you too much to give you honest feedback. My mom thinks you're probably a lovely person, but may not like your work. She's willing to try to use your website and tell you how she really feels.</p>

      <p>FAQ:</p>

      <p> • <b>Will you actually do this?</b> <i>Yes.</i></p>

      <p> • <b>Who are you?</b> <i>I'm Scotty, an entrepreneur and developer. Here's my <a class='website' href="http://scottyallen.com">website</a> and my <a class='website' href="https://twitter.com/scottyallen">twitter</a>.</i> 

      <i>Richard is a UX professional and developer. Here is his <a class='website' href="http://burntfen.com">website</a>, his <a class='website' href="https://github.com/RichardLitt">github</a>, his <a class='website' href="https://twitter.com/richlitt">twitter</a>, and his <a class='website' href="http://theuserisdrunk.com">professional drinking problem</a>.</i></p>

      <p> • <b>Is this related to theuserisdrunk.com?</b> <i>Yes. Richard set that up, and then figured there was a niche here. Richard's mom has too much on her plate; Scotty asked his, and here we are.</i></p>

      <p> • <b>How did you convince your mom to do this?</b> <i>I told her Richard was tired of getting drunk for money. And I told her I'd split the money with her.</i></p>
      <p> • <b>Can I pay your mom to review a porn site?</b> <i>Dude, no. I'll refund your money if I'm too embarrassed to show your site to her.</i></p>
      <p> • <b>Will you post her screencasts publicly?</b> <i>Yes.</i></p>
      <p> • <b>My mom would be perfect for this - can I sign her up?</b> <i>Yes! We're accepting suggestions for future moms to work with, so we can review more sites.  Fill out this <a class="website" href="">form</a>.</i></p> 
      <br />


        <p class='intern'>Richard also reviews websites while both <a href="theuserisdrunk.com">drunk</a> and <a href="mailto:richard@theuserismymom.com" >sober</a>. If you're interested in that, please get in touch. I do stuff too, I guess. </p>

      <p class='intern'><i>Think of my mom like your mom, but with a bit more tough love, and no offers of milk and cookies while you're working. Actually, speaking of offers, let's be clear; my mom will review your website. She will not give a 100% comprehensive review. She may miss some things. She will probably get distracted. Richard or I will be helping her review the site, making sure she has someone to ask questions so she doesn't get too mired in your unusable website. We promise to make sure at least some of the feedback is insightful. We will promise not to hurt any animals in the process. She may review Facebook, Twitter, or the internet at large by accident while reviewing your website - we're sorry. And for the record, no, she will not be drunk. Probably. </i></p>
