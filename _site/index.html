      <h1>Your website should be so simple, a mom could use it.</h1>
      <h1>Is your mom's feedback too loving? Ask mine.</h1>

      <p><b>WHAT</b>: I'll get my mom to review your website. I'll send you a document outlining my mom's frustations, what I think you could do to fix that, and a screencast of her going over the website.</p>
      <p><b>HOW MUCH</b>: $250 per site.</p>

      <p>More details:</p>
      <p>My mom is a lovely woman who tutors SAT/ACT students, and likes quilting and hiking. She has a love/hate relationship with technology, doesn't know what a twitter is, and only recently discovered how to find windows she's minimized. She's perfect.</p>

      <p>One of the core tenets of UX is that you should design with your mother in mind. She should be able to understand and use any feature of your site, because if she can't figure it out, other users will struggle as well. Makes sense, right?.  The thing is, it is hard to test.</p>

      <p>Let's tell the truth - your mom loves you too much to give you honest feedback. My mom thinks you're probably a lovely person, but may not like your work. We've talked about it, and she's willing to try to use your website, and let you know how she actually feels about it.</p>

      <p>FAQ:</p>

      <p> • Will you actually do this? <i>Yes.</i></p>
      <p> • Who are you? <i>I'm Scotty, an entrepreneur and developer. Here's my <a class='website' href="http://scottyallen.com">website</a> and my <a class='website' href="https://twitter.com/scottyallen">twitter</a>.</i> 

      <i>Richard is a UX professional and developer. Here is his <a class='website' href="http://burntfen.com">website</a>, his <a class='website' href="https://github.com/RichardLitt">github</a>, his <a class='website' href="https://twitter.com/richlitt">twitter</a>, and his <a class='website' href="http://theuserisdrunk.com">professional drinking problem</a>.</i></p>

      <p> • Is this related to theuserisdrunk.com? <i>Yes. Richard set that up, and then figured there was a niche there. Richard's mom passed; Scotty volunteered his, and here we are.</i></p>

      <p> • How did you convince your mom to do this? <i>I told her Richard was tired of getting drunk for money. And I told her I'd split the money with her.</i></p>
      <p> • Can I pay your mom to review a porn site? <i>Dude, no. I'll refund your money if I'm too embarrassed to show your site to her.</i></p>
      <p> • Will you post her screencasts publicly? <i>Yes.</i></p>
      <p> • Wasn't this cheaper earlier? <i>Maybe. Raising my prices is my way of throttling the amount of jobs. My mom is a busy lady.</i></p>
      <!-- <p> • My mom would be perfect for this - can I sign her up? <i>Yes! We're accepting suggestions for future moms to work with, so we can review more sites.  Fill out this <a class="website" href="">form</a></i></p> <!-- TODO ! -->

        <p class='intern'>Richard also reviews websites while both <a href="theuserisdrunk.com">drunk</a> and <a href="http://theuserisnew.com">sober</a>. If you're interested in that, please get in touch. Scotty does stuff too I guess. </p>

      <p class='intern'><i>Think of my mom like your mom, but with a bit more tough love, and no offers of milk and cookies while you're working. Actually, speaking of offers, let's be clear; my mom will review your website. She will not give a 100% comprehensive review. She may miss some things. She will probably get distracted. I or Richard will be helping her review the site, making sure she has someone to ask questions to so she doesn't get too mired in your bad UX. We promise to make sure at least some of the feedback is insightful. We will promise not to hurt any animals in the process. She may review Facebook, Twitter, or the internet at large by accident while reviewing your website - we're sorry. And for the record, no, she will not be drunk. Uh... probably. </i></p>
